<img alt="Logo" align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46647517/172828514-014511e3-9a57-449d-b1ca-2ad7a28b59e4.png" width="25%">

The most advanced CLI for custom aspnet webapp creation (At least its going to be :D)

Create WebApi with Vue/React, add features you want (like logging, swagger), use already configured tools from [asp-awesome-templates](https://github.com/MadL1me/aspnet-awesome-templates). Inspired by create-react-app.

## Quick start

Cli tool is currently supported as [dotnet tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-install). 

(Soon will be also available as Chocolately package, apt-get, brew, etc)

1. Install tool as dotnet tool:

```sh
dotnet tool install --global create-aspnet-app --version 0.2.0
```

2. Run create-asp-net app as cli: 

```sh
create-aspnet-app
```
